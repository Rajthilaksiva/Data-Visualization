Data-Visualization
Problem Statement: Accidents can happen anywhere and are often caused by negligent driving or harsh weather conditions. Insurance companies must be prepared to estimate the number of accidents and claims they may receive at any given time. By understanding the patterns of claims, these companies can create different types of policies for their users, providing better benefits while also increasing the company's premiums.

Project Scope: In the course of this project, I undertook a comprehensive data exploration, developed various graphical representations, and extracted significant insights. I conceptualized a storyboard that presents a definitive goal which follows a well-reasoned sequence to demonstrate the progress made towards achieving this aim. The storyboard is intended to furnish the Senior Management with a high-level overview, which they can use to make informed decisions concerning claims system.
